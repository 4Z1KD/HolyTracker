# Holy Tracker

<h3>
In these days of bad propagation on the HF bands, one can experience frustration trying to hunt a small group of mobile contesters from the Holyland during the Holyland contest.<br/>
Holy Tracker allows 4X/4Z stations to actively publish their QTH and working frequency so they are easily found.<br/>
